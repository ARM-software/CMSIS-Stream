config CMSISSTREAM_EVENT_QUEUE_LENGTH
    int "Length of an event queue"
    default 20
    help
      This is the number of events that can be queued in an event queue.
      In case of overflow of the queue, new events are dropped.

config CMSISSTREAM_NB_MAX_EVENTS 
    int "Maximum number of events expected in the system at a given time"
    default 20
    help 
      This is used to size the memory pools involved in event creation.
      Several event queues will use the same pool so this number
      may be bigger than the event queue length.

config CMSISSTREAM_NB_MAX_BUFS 
    int "Maximum number of buffers (tensors ...) expected in the system at a given time"
    default 20
    help 
      This used to size the memory pool involved in atomic
      reference counting of buffers (tensors ...).
      An event may hold references to several buffers so this number
      may be bigger than the number of events.


config CMSISSTREAM_STREAM_THREAD_PRIORITY  
    int "Priority of stream thread"
    default 0
    help 
        This is the priority of the thread running the stream graph processing.
        It should be set according to the application real-time requirements.

config CMSISSTREAM_EVT_HIGH_PRIORITY 
    int "Priority of high priority event thread"
    default 4 
    help 
        This is the priority of the thread running high priority events.
        It should be lower priority than the stream thread priority.

config CMSISSTREAM_EVT_NORMAL_PRIORITY 
    int "Priority of normal priority event thread"
    default 5
    help 
        This is the priority of the thread running normal priority events.
        It should be lower priority than the high priority event thread.

config CMSISSTREAM_EVT_LOW_PRIORITY 
    int "Priority of low priority event thread"
    default 6
    help 
        This is the priority of the thread running low priority events.
        It should be lower priority than the normal priority event thread.

config CMSISSTREAM_EVT_THREAD_STACK_SIZE

    default 4096

config CMSISSTREAM_STREAM_THREAD_STACK_SIZE 
    int "Stack size of stream thread"

config CMSISSTREAM_POOL_SIZE 
    int "Size allocated for the memory pools for event system"
    default 800
    help 
        This is the total size allocated for the memory pool heap
        used by the event system (events, buffers ...).
        This heap contains atomic reference counted shared pointer, mutexes,
        list of arguments for events ...
        It must be big enough to accommodate all these structures and the size will depend
        on the number of events and buffers in the system as well as the maximum
        number of arguments per event.

config CMSISSTREAM_TENSOR_MAX_DIMENSIONS 
    int "Maximum number of tensor dimensions"
    default 3
    help 
      It defines the maximum number of dimensions for tensors used in the CMSIS Stream library.
      The default value of 3 is suitable for image oriented applications (height, width, channels).

config CMSISSTREAM_MAX_NUMBER_EVENT_ARGUMENTS
    int "Maximum number of arguments in an event"
    default 4
    help 
        It defines the maximum number of arguments that can be passed in an event.
        This number impacts the size of memory pools used by the event system.
