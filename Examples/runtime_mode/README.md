# README

This example is **very experimental**.

It is a test of a runtime mode (graph can be changed at runtime without recompiling).

The runtime mode **can** use the schedule pre-computed by the Python script.

The runtime mode **supports** cyclo-static scheduling

Current test is running one iteration of the scheduling.

But the content of the scheduling is defined in `sched_flat.dat` loaded at runtime.

## Limitations:

Those limitations are not temporary.

* No way to have different FIFO implementations for different branches
* No direct support of pure C function. They have to be packaged into a C++ wrapper (original  build mode can call directly a pure function with no state)

## Differences

Static mode node identification is using a `#define` generated by the Python.

The runtime mode is using a `std::string` : the name of the node defined in the Python.

(Only when identification mode is on and a specific node must be identified. Otherwise names are not used)
